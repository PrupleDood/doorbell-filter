Website uses ai models to distinguish between residents, unknown people, and packages. 


Doorbell Filter AI is a machine learning model that is designed to distinguish 
residents, packages, and unknown people. It is trained on over 8,000 images 
to recognize humans, packages, and faces. 

This ensures you are not alerted for small movements which could take 
away from the important notifications like breakins or package theft.
